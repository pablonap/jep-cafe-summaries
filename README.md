# JEP CAFE SUMMARY

## Purpose of this repository

<p style="font-size: 1.2em">• The aim of this repository is to summarize JEP Cafe videos from the Java Youtube channel (youtube.com/@java) in a way that this content can be studied more in depth.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.2em">• Each folder's title is the same as the YouTube video.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.2em">• Inside of each folder you'll find the pdf file with the summary of that video that's not an exact transcription of it, since some text was removed and to go more in depth another things were added. Also you may find a folder named codes where I added code examples (that are not necessary present in the video) to make more clear the concepts.</p>
